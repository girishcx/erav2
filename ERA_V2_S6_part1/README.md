# This document shows main steps of backup propagation

## Neural network description and values used to demonstrate backup propagation

### This neural network has 2 inputs and 2 outputs target outputs to predict is 0.5 with an objective to minimize total error at various learning rates

### it has 2 layers, each layer has neuron with sigma activation weights/learning coming from both the neurons or input

### output of each neuron go to next layer neuron and never cross connect

### 0.05 and 0.1 are inputs, initial weights we start with w1,w2,w3 and w4 as 0.1,0.15,0.2,0.25 and

### w5,w6,w7 and w8 as 0.4, 0.45, 0.5 and 0.55
